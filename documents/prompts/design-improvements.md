# Login page
- Make the login page UI look like the image file : `documents/prompts/images/login.jpeg`
- Use purely in tailwind CSS & no external file
- Use the design same as shown, looks like a compact card in the centre

You are a senior front-end engineer and UI/UX specialist with strong expertise in modern React applications and Tailwind CSS.

You are given a reference login page design (attached image). Your task is to improve and refine the login page while strictly preserving the existing visual style, layout language, and aesthetic.

Visual & Design Constraints (Must Follow)

Maintain the same gradient background (purple / violet tones)

Preserve the glassmorphism-style card

Soft translucency

Subtle blur

Rounded corners

Gentle shadow

Keep the centered card layout

Maintain the typography hierarchy (heading, helper text, labels)

Preserve the button styling (gradient primary CTA)

Keep spacing, proportions, and visual balance consistent

The end result should feel like a polished iteration, not a redesign

Functional Improvements to Apply

Improve accessibility (labels, contrast, focus states)

Add proper form validation states (error, success, disabled)

Improve hover, focus, and active states for:

Inputs

Buttons

Links

Add subtle micro-interactions (transitions, hover feedback)

Ensure responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop)

UX Enhancements (Optional but Preferred)

Better visual feedback for password visibility toggle

Clear loading state on “Sign In” button

Non-intrusive error messaging placement

Maintain calm, professional, fintech-style UX

Technical Requirements

Use React + TypeScript

Use Tailwind CSS only (no custom CSS files)

Keep code modular and clean

Avoid unnecessary libraries

Follow production-ready best practices

Output Expectations

Do NOT change the overall look and feel

Do NOT introduce new colors outside the existing palette

Do NOT redesign layout or structure

Focus on refinement, polish, and usability

The final result should look like the same design, but clearly more professional, accessible, and production-ready.
